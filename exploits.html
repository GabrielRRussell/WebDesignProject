		<h2>Exploits - The Thing That Did It All</h2>

		<p>Exploits were not very common at all in the beginning of the last few years. The only real exploit was Ninjhax, which was loaded using a QR code. You had to create a new application/payload for every different tool you wanted. Sure, it was annoying, but it was pretty neat to have something to work with. Over time, more and more different exploits came up, and the Hax* payload was created. A universal payload adapted from Ninjhax, all you needed was a way to load it and it would do the rest. So tons of exploits came up every other week. Ninjhax looked slightly different, but here was the Hax* payload loading via the Oot3dHax* exploit (pictured to the side).</p>

		<p>Please note that GenHax is not included because it requires a Japanese copy of the game, plus the encryption key. Since the page is in english, JPN exclusive exploits were not included. SmileBasic and BASICSploit were different exploits, too. Secondary Exploits (Exploits requiring previous install or another exploit), are not included. <a href = "https://www.smealum.github.io/3ds">Here</a> is where you can find secondary exploits and a few old primaries.</p>
